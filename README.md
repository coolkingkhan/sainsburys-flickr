# Task

This task is intended to test your ability to consume a JSON API, process some data and present it. While there is no specific time limit, 
we would not expect you to spend any longer than 2 hours completing this.

Feel free to explain briefly the problems you’ve encountered and the choices you’ve made when returning the test. 
This is normally not necessary as the test should speak for itself.

# Requirements
You need to build a page that shows pictures using this https://www.flickr.com/services/feeds/docs/photos_public/ flickr service.
Users should be able to:

1. toggle their favourites photos by clicking on them (please add a selected class to the img element when selected)

2. deselect a selected photo by clicking on it

3. reload the page, the previously selected pictures should be remembered.

You have complete freedom to choose whatever library/framework you want to use (both JS and CSS).
The use of JQuery is discouraged.

Note : We'll only be testing in Chrome so don't worry about crossbrowser compatibility.
